File Planning the Project 

Research & Writing Component: 
- Research Question Does religious opinions affect a person's view on other freedom of speech?
- External Sources used (APA citing) 

Technical Content: 
 - data files imported properly 
- attention is paid to the complexities of the source data (missing data, coded values, sample weighing)
- tabular data structures are used correctly & tidy data standards are followed
- Pandas operations are used properly
- Data Visualization are properly coded, sufficiently polished and used effectively

Required components: 
use pandas to read data as DataFrame  (done)
use at least one helper function of your own design, defined in Jupyter Notebook or imported from a local Python script (.py file) 
use pandas groupby with an aggregation method (agg, count, first, max, sum, mean, etc.)
use pandas' apply method at least once to transform or create a variable
use pandas' .loc, iloc, or .at to filter data
use three of the following utility methods from pandas: sort_values, reset_index, set_index, fillna, dropna, astype, rename, drop, head, tail, describe
use pandas to write data subset as .csv file or files
use pandas' cut or qcut to create data bins
display inline at least one scatter plot, one line plot, one sequence of boxplots (using matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

edits to data: changing the input to its actual meaning e.g: income/ partyid to being the actual words

REDO possible dependent variables:
childs - number of children (1972-2022)

independent variables:

age - age of respondent
relig - r's religious preference
partyid - political party affiliation
income - total family income

abdefect - (believe abortion should be legal when) strong chance of serious defect
abnomore - (believe abortion should be legal when) married--wants no more children
abhlth - (believe abortion should be legal when) woman's health seriously endangered

absingle - (believe abortion should be legal when) not married
abany - (believe abortion should be legal when) abortion if woman wants for any reason
If yes to all, abgen = always; if no to all, abgen = never; if yes to some but not all, abgen = sometimes
(need to account for years before abany was added (1977))
